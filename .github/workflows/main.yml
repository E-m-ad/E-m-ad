          git add README.md
          git commit -m "Update solved problems count"
          git push
```

The workflow is triggered every day at 12:00 AM UTC (you can adjust the cron expression if needed). It fetches the number of solved problems using your custom script, updates the README file with the latest count, and commits and pushes the changes.
